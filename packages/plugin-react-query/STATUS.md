# React Query Plugin Status

## ✅ Completed
1. **Imported all React Query dev tools** - Complete copy from old project
2. **Added all dependencies** - FlashList, reanimated, gesture-handler as peer deps
3. **Copied all shared dependencies** - UI components, utils, storage keys
4. **Created plugin structure** - index.tsx exports the plugin
5. **JavaScript compilation works** - Module builds successfully

## 🔧 Current Issues
1. **TypeScript errors** - Missing type definitions for some dependencies
2. **App cache issue** - Need to restart app to pick up new plugin
3. **Import paths** - Some relative imports may need adjustment

## 📦 What's Included
- Complete React Query browser with search/filter
- Mutation browser with status tracking  
- Data editor for modifying query data
- Network toggle functionality
- Query actions (invalidate, refetch, remove)
- Modal persistence
- Swipe navigation between tabs
- All original UI components and styling

## 🚀 Next Steps to Get Working
1. Restart the app completely (kill and restart)
2. Clear Metro cache if needed
3. Fix any remaining import path issues
4. Add TypeScript type definitions for peer deps
