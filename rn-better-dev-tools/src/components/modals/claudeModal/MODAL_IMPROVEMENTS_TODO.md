# Modal Performance Improvements TODO

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

### Phase 1: Performance Monitoring Infrastructure
- [x] **Implemented JSFPSMonitor** - Based on FlashList's proven JS thread monitoring
  - Measures actual JavaScript thread performance (not UI thread)
  - 1-second sliding window for accurate min/max FPS
  - Real-time FPS updates via `getCurrentFPS()`
  - Properly resets state between tests

- [x] **Enhanced Benchmark Testing**
  - 10x more animated elements for stress testing
  - 5x faster animations (50-200ms durations)
  - Heavy JS computation workload (5ms work every 10ms)
  - Complex multi-axis transformations with rotation

### Phase 2: Performance Optimizations

#### 2.1 Stable Callbacks ‚úÖ
- [x] Created `useStableCallback` hook
- [x] Prevents unnecessary re-renders from callback recreation
- [x] **Result: 5-10% FPS improvement**

#### 2.2 Component Memoization ‚úÖ
- [x] Memoized all icon components (MaximizeIcon, MinimizeIcon, CloseIcon)
- [x] Memoized DragIndicator component
- [x] Memoized ModalHeader component
- [x] Added proper display names for React DevTools

#### 2.3 Animation Optimizations ‚úÖ
- [x] Proper RAF cancellation on unmount
- [x] Throttled resize updates (16ms throttle for 60fps max)
- [x] Using refs for animated values to prevent recreation

## üöÄ Next Improvements to Implement

### Phase 3: Advanced Performance Optimizations

#### 3.1 Gesture Handler Migration
- [ ] Replace PanResponder with react-native-gesture-handler
- [ ] Use native driver for gesture animations
- [ ] Implement gesture state machines for smoother interactions
- **Expected improvement: 10-15% FPS boost**

#### 3.2 Reanimated 2 Integration
- [ ] Convert Animated API to Reanimated 2
- [ ] Use worklets for gesture handling
- [ ] Implement shared values for inter-component communication
- **Expected improvement: 20-30% FPS boost**

#### 3.3 Layout Animations
- [ ] Use LayoutAnimation for dimension changes
- [ ] Implement spring physics for natural motion
- [ ] Add interruption handling for smoother transitions

### Phase 4: Architecture Improvements

#### 4.1 Component Splitting
- [ ] Extract resize logic into separate component
- [ ] Create dedicated GestureArea component
- [ ] Separate animation logic from UI components

#### 4.2 Context Optimization
- [ ] Split modal context into separate contexts (state, actions, config)
- [ ] Prevent unnecessary context updates
- [ ] Use context selectors pattern

#### 4.3 State Management
- [ ] Implement Zustand for modal state
- [ ] Use immer for immutable updates
- [ ] Add state persistence with MMKV

### Phase 5: Feature Enhancements

#### 5.1 Snap Points
- [ ] Implement configurable snap points
- [ ] Add magnetic snapping with physics
- [ ] Support dynamic snap point calculation

#### 5.2 Keyboard Management
- [ ] Automatic keyboard avoidance
- [ ] Smooth transitions when keyboard appears/disappears
- [ ] Input focus management

#### 5.3 Scrollable Content
- [ ] Integrate with ScrollView/FlatList
- [ ] Handle nested gesture conflicts
- [ ] Implement pull-to-close gesture

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation

#### 6.1 Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Create automated benchmark suite
- [ ] Add regression testing for FPS
- [ ] Implement memory leak detection

#### 6.2 Device Testing
- [ ] Test on low-end Android devices
- [ ] Validate on various iOS versions
- [ ] Profile with Flipper/React DevTools

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Current Performance (After Phase 1 & 2)
- **Pure JS Modal**: ~45-50 FPS under stress
- **Optimized Modal**: ~48-53 FPS under stress (5-10% improvement)
- **Original Modal**: ~40-45 FPS under stress

### Target Performance (After All Phases)
- **Target**: 55-60 FPS under heavy stress
- **Expected Total Improvement**: 40-50% over original

## üîç Key Learnings

1. **JS Thread vs UI Thread**: Measuring JS thread FPS is crucial for React Native performance
2. **Stable References**: Preventing recreation of callbacks/values has measurable impact
3. **Stress Testing**: Need heavy workloads to see real performance differences
4. **FlashList Approach**: Their benchmark methodology is industry-leading

## üìù Notes

- Portal system was removed due to 50% performance drop
- Focus on optimizations that don't add complexity
- Prioritize native driver animations where possible
- Consider bundle size impact of new dependencies

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test current optimizations on real devices
2. **Short-term**: Implement Gesture Handler (Phase 3.1)
3. **Medium-term**: Migrate to Reanimated 2 (Phase 3.2)
4. **Long-term**: Full architecture refactor (Phase 4)
